This is the e-commerce site offering client services and tools. 
It was my first external project, where I collaborated with fellow students, working seamlessly and always ready to assist each other.

My contributions to this site include:

      * Structuring the site - creating a comprehensive tree structure for all files and folders, downloading fonts, and connecting them. Worked on site IcoMoon (created icon-fonts).
      * Header - made with links to various sections of the site.
      * Burger-menu - featuring links to all sections of the site, capable of opening and closing with a click (only for tablet and mobile versions). Includes social media buttons and language switch.
      * "Delivery" Block - with input fields for name and phone, along with a "Leave a Request" button.
      * "Company Offers" Block - with a "Read More" button expanding the preview text.
      * Favicon and all Meta-Data tags.
      * Footer with the "Up" button.
      * "Developers" Page.
      * English version of the site.
      * Made all my sections under Perfect Pixel.

During my work on this project, I utilized HTML, CSS for typesetting (extensively employing flex), JavaScript (for functionalities like "Read More" and "Up" buttons, and Burger-menu), Git repository, and PerfectPixel. 
I also used the Bootstrap library, converted and compressed images, and worked with Figma and Trello.

The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets with adaptive adjustments for images, buttons, and text. 
I connected buttons to links for social networking and sharing, making them responsive to user actions with active and hover states. 
Additionally, I implemented transitions between site pages and used links to seamlessly navigate various blocks. 

The JavaScript code for the "Up" button assists users in returning to the header from any block on the site.
Also, it helps users read more text with a "Read More" button that expands the preview text.
