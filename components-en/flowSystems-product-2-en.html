                     FILTRONS Standart (softening P5 + CBC + UM, tap drop) provides universal cleaning of tap water from
                     mechanical impurities (rust, sludge, sand, etc.), as well as dissolved impurities, such as free
                     chlorine, organochlorine compounds, pesticides, petroleum products, heavy metals and other organic
                     and inorganic substances. Eliminates unpleasant odors and improves the taste of water. Due to the
                     presence of the cartridge with ion-exchange resin softens the water.
                  </p>
                  <p>Cleaning is carried out in 3 stages:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>1st stage - mechanical cleaning is carried out with a cartridge made of foamed polypropylene,
                        the filtration degree is 5 microns. Removes rust, sludge particles, clay, sand, microorganisms,
                        fibers and other impurities of organic and inorganic origin.
                        Resource: approximately 6000 liters.
                     </li>
                     <li>2nd degree - softening, water purification: removal of hardness salts (calcium and magnesium),
                        partially - iron.
                        The softening cartridge is filled with ion exchange resin. Due to which there is a replacement
                        of hardness ions Ca2 + and Mg2 +, as well as (partially) dissolved ferrous iron - Fe2 + with
                        sodium ions Na +. These salts are the cause of the formation of scale on the devices, as well as
                        the heating of water. In addition, dissolved iron is the cause of the unpleasant smell and taste
                        of water.
                        Resource: approximately 6 months.
                     </li>
                     <li>3rd degree - purification of water from chlorine, organic compounds, odors, flavors.
                        The activated carbon cartridge of coconut shells removes chlorine, organic and organochlorine
                        substances from the water. It has an increased possibility of adsorption of organic compounds
                        and free chlorine, removes color, odor.
                        Resource: approximately 6 months.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The resource of replaceable cartridges and reverse osmosis membrane is given approximately and
                     depends on the quality of the source water.</p>

                     Filtrons Premium triple filter is an affordable solution for efficient drinking water purification.
                     Filtration is carried out in 3 stages, for each of which a separate cartridge is provided in the
                     filter. Filter water can be used for daily drinking, cooking and drinking, watering flowers, as
                     well as for vaporization in household appliances (irons, steamers, humidifiers). The filter
                     combines high quality and affordable cost of purified water.
                     1 Stage: Delays large particles: sand, rust, silt. 2 Stage: Provides additional water softening. 3
                     Stage: At the end there is a fine purification of water in the cartridge from briquetted coal. The
                     cartridge is made of coconut activated carbon of high quality, so that the water becomes extremely
                     pleasant to the taste. Triple water filter is designed for post-treatment of cold tap water. To
                     obtain clean drinking water of spring quality, we recommend replacing cartridges every 6 months
                     with a set regardless of the volume of filtered water.
