                            The 10 inch slim Organic flask is a replaceable housing for household filters and reverse
                            osmosis systems. Made of durable white plastic. White flasks are used as second and/or third
                            stages of filtration for carbon cartridges or softening. On cartridges of this type, sealing
                            rings are installed on both sides. When installed in a flask, the cartridge is fixed at the
                            top and bottom. It has compactness, reliability, durability and resistance to differences in
                            main pressure. Consists of 2 main parts: white cover with plastic thread 1/4 inch, white
                            flask with two rings of seals. Provided for a large range of cartridges.

                            The Slim 10 Organic flask filter works according to the following principle: water under

                            the next filtration stage or to the outside of the filter. The life of the cartridge depends
                            on the degree of contamination and the amount of filtered water. Any cartridge, regardless
                            of its type, has a certain resource, after the development of which it is necessary to make
                            a replacement. Unscrew the flask with a key, remove the old cartridge and rinse the flask
                            with water. Insert a new cartridge, screw the housing to the cover until it stops.

                            The 20 BB Organic flask is a replaceable housing for household filters and reverse osmosis
                            systems. Made of durable blue plastic. Blue flasks are used as second and/or third stages of
                            filtration for carbon cartridges or softening. Sealing rings are installed on cartridges of
                            this type on both sides. When installed in a flask, the cartridge is fixed at the top and
                            bottom. It has compactness, reliability, durability and resistance to differences in main
                            pressure. It consists of 2 main parts: a black cover with a plastic thread of 1 inch, a blue
                            flask with two sealing rings. Provided for a wide range of cartridges.

                        <p>
                            Filter flask 20 BB Organic works on the principle: water under pressure enters the body of
                            the flask, passes through the cartridge and cleaned moves to the next stage of filtration or
                            to the outside of the filter. The life of the cartridge depends on the level of
                            contamination and the amount of filtered water. Any cartridge, regardless of its type, has a
                            certain resource, after the development of which it is necessary to make a replacement.
                            Unscrew the flask with a key, reach the old cartridge and rinse the flask with water. Insert
                            new cartridge, attach housing to cover until stop.

                            The 10 inch slim Organic flask is a replaceable housing for household filters and reverse
                            osmosis systems. Made of durable white plastic. White flasks are used as second and/or third
                            stages of filtration for carbon cartridges or softening. Sealing rings are installed on
                            cartridges of this type on both sides. When installed in a flask, the cartridge is fixed at
                            the top and bottom. It has compactness, reliability, durability and resistance to
                            differences in main pressure. Consists of 2 main parts: white cover with plastic thread 1/4
                            inch, white flask with one seal ring. Provided for a wide range of cartridges.

                            The Slim 10 Organic flask filter works according to the following principle: water under
                            pressure enters the flask body, passes through the cartridge and the cleaned one moves to
                            the next filtration stage or to the outside of the filter. The life of the cartridge depends
                            on the degree of contamination and the amount of filtered water. Any cartridge, regardless
                            of its type, has a certain resource, after the development of which it is necessary to make
                            a replacement. Unscrew the flask with a key, remove the old cartridge and rinse the flask
                            with water. Insert a new cartridge, screw the housing to the cover until it stops.

                            The 10 inch slim flask is a replaceable housing for household filters and reverse osmosis
                            systems. Made of durable white plastic. White flasks are used as second and/or third stages
                            of filtration for carbon cartridges or softening. On cartridges of this type, sealing rings
                            are installed on both sides. When installed in a flask, the cartridge is fixed at the top
                            and bottom. It has compactness, reliability, durability and resistance to differences in
                            main pressure. Consists of 2 main parts: white cover with plastic thread 1/4 inch, white
                            flask with two rings of seals. Provided for a large range of cartridges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Slim 10 flask filter works according to the following principle: water under pressure
                            enters the flask body, passes through the cartridge and the cleaned one moves to the next
                            filtration stage or to the outside of the filter. The life of the cartridge depends on the
                            degree of contamination and the amount of filtered water. Any cartridge, regardless of its
                            type, has a certain resource, after the development of which it is necessary to make a
                            replacement. Unscrew the flask with a key, remove the old cartridge and rinse the flask with
                            water. Insert a new cartridge, screw the housing to the cover until it stops.
