                            The reverse osmosis water purification system is designed for post-treatment of water in
                            domestic conditions for its further use for drinking, cooking and other purposes. It is a
                            system that removes up to 99.9% of all impurities contained in water and prevents the
                            formation of scale on heating devices. Filtration is carried out by passing water under
                            pressure through a semi-permeable membrane, which passes only water and oxygen molecules.

                                membrane is irreversible and leads to a complete stop of the water purification process.
                                Therefore, a preliminary three-stage filtration of incoming water is used, and the
                                membrane is organized so that all contaminants entering it do not settle on its surface,

                            The Pallas Viva 5 reverse osmosis filter is developed by European specialists, made of
                            high-quality material in Turkey. The filter has a universal size of filter materials, which
                            significantly reduces the cost of its maintenance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The filter comes with a storage capacity of 12 liters with a useful volume of 8-9 liters and
                            a stylish Modern tap.
                        </p>
                        <p>The filter is ideal for both drinking and cooking.</p>
                        <p>
                            For proper filtration, water must be supplied to the reverse osmosis system under a pressure
                            of 3 atm. If the pressure in the water supply system is not enough, then a pump is used to
                            increase the pressure.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Mechanical polypropylene fiber cartridge with a filtration rating of 5 μm. The
                                mechanical filter is used for pre-treatment of water in front of the membrane element.
                            </li>
                            <li>An activated carbon cartridge designed to remove substances harmful to humans and the
                                membrane element, such as organic compounds, chlorine and chlorine compounds</li>
                            <li>The briquetted carbon cartridge is used for deeper cleaning of solutes in water.</li>
                            <li>Membrane element. A semi-permeable membrane with pores of 0.8-1.2 nanometers purifies
                                water from bacteria, viruses, heavy metals by 95-98% and discharges them into the sewer
                                with part of the discharged water.</li>
                            <li>Postcarbon. Water enters the last stage of purification - a carbon filter to improve the
                                organoleptic qualities of water.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For correct and long-term operation of the reverse osmosis system, it is necessary to replace
                            the filter elements in time. The first three cartridges should be replaced at least every 6
                            months, the membrane element serves up to 3 years and depends on the quality of the
                            pre-treatment of the incoming water, postcarbon - once a year.
                        </p>
                        <p>The storage capacity of the filter can be positioned both vertically and horizontally.</p>

                            The Pallas Viva 5 reverse osmosis filter is developed by European specialists, made of
                            high-quality material in Turkey. The filter has a universal size of filter materials, which
                            significantly reduces the cost of its maintenance.

                        <p>
                            The filter comes with a storage capacity of 12 liters with a useful volume of 8-9 liters and
                            a stylish Modern tap.
                        </p>
                        <p>The filter is ideal for both drinking and cooking.</p>
                        <p>
                            For proper filtration, water must be supplied to the reverse osmosis system under a pressure
                            of 3 atm. If the pressure in the water supply system is not enough, then a pump is used to
                            increase the pressure.

                                water from bacteria, viruses, heavy metals by 95-98% and discharges them into the sewer
                                with part of the discharged water.</li>

                            replace the filter elements in time. The first three cartridges should be replaced at least
                            every 6 months, the membrane element serves up to 3 years and depends on the quality of the
                            pre-treatment of the incoming water, postcarbon - once a year.
                            The storage capacity of the filter can be positioned both vertically and horizontally.

                        <p>
                            The reverse osmosis water purification system is designed for post-treatment of water in
                            domestic conditions for its further use for drinking, cooking and other purposes. It is a
                            system that removes up to 99.9% of all impurities contained in water and prevents the
                            formation of scale in heating devices. Filtration is carried out by passing water under
                            pressure through a semi-permeable membrane, which passes only water and oxygen molecules.
                        </p>
                        <p>Degrees of purification:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1st - mechanical cleaning cartridge Filtrons 5 microns, which removes small debris,
                                sand, rust from the water.</li>
                            <li>2nd - Filtrons carbon cartridge, for removing chlorine from water, as well as organic
                                compounds and pesticides.</li>
                            <li>3rd - Mechanical cleaning cartridge Filtrons 1 micron.</li>
                            <li>4th - Pallas 80 membrane, consisting of a semi-permeable material through which only
                                water and oxygen molecules can pass. Contamination of the filtering surface of the
                                membrane is irreversible and leads to a complete stop of the water purification process.
                                Therefore, a preliminary three-stage filtration of incoming water is used, and the
                                membrane is organized so that all contaminants entering it do not settle on its surface,
                                but are washed into the sewer.</li>
                            <li>5th - Filtrons postfilter, which improves the taste and smell of water after the tank.

                            The water purification system "Filtrons Classic 6 - step" based on reverse osmosis is
                            designed for post-treatment of water in domestic conditions for its further use for

                            It is a system that removes up to 99.9% of all impurities contained in water and prevents
                            the formation of scale on heating devices. Filtration is carried out by passing water under
                            pressure through a semi-permeable membrane, which passes only water and oxygen molecules.

                                water and oxygen molecules can pass. Contamination of the surface of the filtering
                                membrane is irreversible and leads to a complete stop of the water purification process.
                                Therefore, a preliminary three-stage filtration of incoming water is used, and the
                                membrane is organized so that all contaminants entering it do not settle on its surface,
                                but are washed into the sewer.

                        <p>
                            Purifayer PALLAS is a floor model of a water dispenser with a built-in reverse osmosis
                            system, compressor cooling of water and fast heating.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such a system, unlike conventional coolers, is directly connected to the water supply, which
                            automatically makes them a cost-effective solution for constantly providing clean water by
                            cleaning both offices and private houses. Thanks to the built-in reverse osmosis system, tap
                            water will be effectively purified to the level of drinking water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Purification by reverse osmosis is considered the most effective purification! Water will be
                            purified from all harmful impurities, bacteria, viruses, and will not leave scale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rate of water heating in this purifayer reaches 5 l/h. And water is cooled at a speed of
                            2 l/h (In compressor cooling, the cooling rate is higher than in electronic). The PALLAS
                            purifier uses the dual protection function: "temperature control" and "overheat protection."
                            The water temperature is always controlled in the range between 90 ° and 95 °, which meets
                            the requirements for making coffee or tea and cooking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No modern office can be imagined without a cooler or purifier for water, and recently people
                            began to abandon the use of electric kettles in apartments, replacing them with more
                            convenient and multifunctional purifiers for water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Purifayer PALLAS connects to a source of cold tap water very simply and quickly. The entire
                            system of the purifayer in contact with water - connecting tubes, water tanks, the inner
                            surface of the cranes - is made only of high-quality and safe materials.
